# Evaluating a simple polynomial function in VHDL
This repository provides a concise, easy-to-follow, method of modelling and simulation of a polynomial function in VHDL using stepwise refinement.

# Software
The codes were developed using industry standard software, Intel Quartus Prime (digital system design) and ModelSim (simulation software).

# Usage
The codes were developed in this particular order:
1. case_syd - high-level code for polynomial evaluation.
2. vec_syd - low-level code for polynonial evaluation.
3. validOUT - low-level code with controlled output.
4. genericD - adapted generic code.
